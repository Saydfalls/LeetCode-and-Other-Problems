This is a collection of my solutions to leetcode problems.

My goal here is to have somewhat of a diary for me to learn how to problem solve and to take notes on what I learn.
Whether that means coding or coding concepts I'll be learning alot and using a lot to solve problems.
I'm a bit of a traveller so I can't solve problems daily, but everyday that I am home I do try to solve at least one problem.

USING THIS CODE:
Should be as easy as downloading the file and adding a use case.
If you need help understanding what input needs to go into it, you're in luck! The files are named after the leetcode problem, you can just go to leetcode.com, go to problems, and then search the name of the problem.

DO NOT:
Do not use this code to solve your leetcode problems! These solutions are very bad generally.
It would be a better use of your time to figure it out yourself. Same as me.
