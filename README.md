# README

Here are my solutions to all kinds of different problems! I'll be updating it each time I solve a coding problem.

## Heads Up

Problems are organized by where they come from first. This dictates their folder structure. Folder Structure is likely unique to each parent folder.  Advent of Code is structured by year first, then by day of the problem. Leetcode problems is structured by problem difficulty first, and then has additional problems I choose to spend more time optimizing when I'm inspired. SlothBytes Weekly Challenge, is structured by the name of the problem, and if i'm inspired, the problem is then split by iteration. So on and so forth, you get the idea. Feel free to explore!
