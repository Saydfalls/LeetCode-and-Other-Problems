# README

Here are my solutions to all kinds of different problems! I'll be updating it each time I solve a coding problem.

## Heads Up

Problems are organized by where they come from first. This dictates their folder structure. Folder Structure is likely unique to each parent folder.  
- **Advent of Code**: structured by year first, then by day of the problem.
- **Leetcode**: files are structured by problem difficulty first, and then I have an additional file for problems I choose to optimize when I'm inspired.
- **SlothBytes Weekly Challenge**: structured by the problem name, and if I'm inspired, the problem has subfolders split by iteration.

So on and so forth, you get the idea. Feel free to explore!
